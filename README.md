# Ed's Hacker News Reader

Quick HN reader to practise some Javascript and fetching APIs in JS.

It'd be nice to somehow make it faster to load stories but this seems to be a limitation of the API and I don't want to keep a database. There could be a loader while it waits.

It'd also be nice for the pagination buttons not to show until the content has loaded.
